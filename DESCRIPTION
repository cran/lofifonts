Description: Alternate font rendering is useful when rendering text to novel
   graphics outputs where modern font rendering is not available or 
   where bespoke text positioning is required. Bitmap and vector fonts allow for 
   custom layout and rendering using pixel coordinates and line drawing.  
   Formatted text is created as a data.frame of pixel coordinates (for bitmap fonts)
   or stroke coordinates (for vector fonts).  All text can be easily 
   previewed as a matrix or raster image.  
   A selection of fonts is included with this package.
